pub const BEETLE_LONG_DESCRIPTION: &str = "
Iroh is a next-generation implementation the Interplanetary File System (IPFS).
IPFS is a networking protocol for exchanging content-addressed blocks of
immutable data. 'content-addressed' means referring to data by the hash of it's
content, which makes the reference both unique and verifiable. These two
properties make it possible to get data from any node in the network that speaks
the IPFS protocol, including IPFS content being served by other implementations
of the protocol.

For more info see https://beetle.computer/docs";

pub const ADD_LONG_DESCRIPTION: &str = "
WARNING 1: BEETLE CURRENTLY PROVIDES NO WAY TO REMOVE CONTENT ONCE ADDED. 
This will be addressed in a future release.

Add copies the file or directory specified by <PATH> into the beetle store,
splitting the input file into a tree of immutable blocks. Each block is labeled
by the hash of its content. The final output of the add command is the hash of
the root of the tree, which contains references to all other blocks:

  > beetle add cat.jpg
  [1/2] Calculating size...
  [2/2] Importing content 643 B...
  /ipfs/bafybeihjgu5w6wbbxqevdgccj5xm453dbzpkwmkyoepvs3vh6wft4uvf2q

The 'bafybei...' text after /ipfs/ is a Content IDentifier (or CID). The CID for 
different things will always be a different set of characters. Once content is
in IPFS, we refer to it by the CID. The opposite of the add command is the get 
command, which accepts a CID and turns it back into files or directories:

  > beetle get /ipfs/bafybeihjgu5w6wbbxqevdgccj5xm453dbzpkwmkyoepvs3vh6wft4uvf2q
  Saving file(s) to bafybeihjgu5w6wbbxqevdgccj5xm453dbzpkwmkyoepvs3vh6wft4uvf2q

This will create a directory with our cat image inside. We can also make this a 
little nicer for humans by getting just the cat picture:

  > beetle get /ipfs/bafybeihjgu5w6wbbxqevdgccj5xm453dbzpkwmkyoepvs3vh6wft4uvf2q/cat.jpg cat.jpg

The stored result of add is a 'MerkleDAG'. Merkle proofs (hashes) are a fast
method of proving and checking data inclusion, and the tree formed by chunking
the input into blocks is always a directed acyclic graph (DAG). These MerkleDAGs
can be provably checked for tamper resistance by anyone who fetches all blocks
in the tree, which means MerkleDAGs can be provided by anyone, without concern
for tampering.

By default all content added to beetle is available to the configured network, and
the default network is the public IPFS network. We can use a HTTPS gateway 
hosted at https://gateway.lol to fetch the content from our local node:

  > curl https://gateway.lol/ipfs/bafybeihjgu5w6wbbxqevdgccj5xm453dbzpkwmkyoepvs3vh6wft4uvf2q/cat.jpg

Implementation Interop:
Iroh does *not* produce the same hashes as other IPFS implementations when given
the same data. Iroh & other valid implementations can read each other's data,
but if given the same file, Iroh will almost certianly produce a different hash
value.
";

pub const START_LONG_DESCRIPTION: &str = "
Iroh start kicks off 'daemons' on your local machine: long-running processes 
that make beetle work. Iroh requires a running daemon to do anything meaningful 
like get or add content, and `beetle start` is the fastest way to get beetle up &
running locally

Use the start, stop, and status commands to monitor beetle on your local machine,
and control it's uptime. start runs daemons in the background, so there's no 
need to keep your terminal open after running start. Once running, stop beetle 
with `beetle stop`.

Daemons provide 'services'. Services work together to fullfill requests.
There are three services:

  store    -  a database of IPFS content
  p2p      -  peer-2-peer networking functionality
  gateway  -  bridge the IPFS network to HTTP

By default beetle start spins up storage & gateway services. Start the p2p service
with `beetle start p2p`.  To learn more about each service, see:
https://beetle.computer/docs/services

Iroh start is by no means the only way to get beetle up & running. Long running 
local deployments should be scheduled by your operating systems daemon 
supervisior, and cloud deployments should invoke daemon binaries directly. 
Regardless of how beetle is started, you can always use `beetle status` to monitor 
service health.
";

pub const STOP_LONG_DESCRIPTION: &str = "
stop turns local beetle services off by killing daemon processes. There are three
beetle services, each backed by a daemon:

   store    -  a database of IPFS content
   p2p      -  peer-2-peer networking functionality
   gateway  -  bridge the IPFS network to HTTP

By default `beetle stop` attempts to stop all three services. To stop specific
services, provide service names as arguments, eg: `beetle stop p2p`.

When a deamon starts it creates a lockfile and writes it's process identifier 
(PID) to the lock. Iroh stop uses this lock to lookup the process & send an 
interrupt signal to the daemon, which halts the service. Stop will also try to 
clean up any stray lock files in the even that a program crash fails to remove 
the lockfile from the file system.

Stop only works for local processes, and cannot be used to interact with remote
services.
";

pub const STATUS_LONG_DESCRIPTION: &str = "
status reports the current operational setup of beetle. Use status as a go-to
command for understanding where beetle commands are being processed. different
ops configurations utilize different network and service implementations
under the hood, which can lead to varying performance characteristics.

Service status can be in one of four states:

  Down:         The service is not currently running, or is 
                not configured to connect to the proper port.
                
  Serving:      The service is running & healthy
  
  Not Serving:  The service is running, but unhealthy.
  
  Unknown:      The service is in an unknown state. 
                This should not happen.

Use the --watch flag to continually poll for changes.

Status reports no metrics about the running system aside from current service
health. Instead all metrics are emitted through uniform tracing collection &
reporting, which is intended to be consumed by tools like prometheus and
grafana. For more info on metrics collection, see
https://beetle.computer/docs/metrics";

pub const GET_LONG_DESCRIPTION: &str = "
Download file or directory specified by <ipfs-path> from IPFS into [path]. If
path already exists and is a file then it's overwritten with the new downloaded
file. If path already exists and is a directory, the command fails with an
error. If path already exists, is a file and the downloaded data is a directory,
that's an error.

By default, the output will be written to the working directory. If no file or
directory name can be derived from the <ipfs-path>, the output will be written
to the given path's CID.

If <ipfs-path> is already present in the beetle store, no network call will
be made.";

pub const P2P_CONNECT_LONG_DESCRIPTION: &str = "
Attempts to open a new direct connection to a peer address. By default p2p
continulously maintains an open set of peer connections based on requests &
internal hueristics. Connect is useful in situations where it makes sense to
manually force libp2p to dial a known peer. A common example includes when you
know the multiaddr or peer ID of a peer that you would like to exchange data
with.

The address format is in multiaddr format. For example:

 > beetle p2p connect /ip4/104.131.131.82/tcp/4001/p2p/QmaCpDMGvV2BGHeYERUEnRQAwe3N8SzbUtfsmvsqQLuvuJ

for more info on multiaddrs see https://beetle.computer/docs/concepts#multiaddr

If a peer ID is provided, connect first perform a distribtued hash table (DHT)
lookup to learn the address of the given peer ID before dialing.";

pub const P2P_LOOKUP_LONG_DESCRIPTION: &str = "
Takes as input a peer ID or address and prints the output of the libp2p-identify
protocol. When provided with a peer ID, the address is looked up on the 
Network's Distributed Hash Table (DHT) before connecting to the node. When 
provided with a multiaddress, the connection is dialed directly.

Providing no <ADDR> argument will return your local node information.

lookup will output 6 types of the info about the peer:

  Peer ID             - the identifier of the peer
  Agent Version       - software identifier similar to a web browser's user agent
  Protocol Version    - broad identifier for the peer & it's network
  Observed Addresses  - the peer's best guess at it's own public address(es)
                        based on feedback from other peers
  Listening Addresses - address this peer is listening for connections on
  Protocols           - identifiers for protocols this peer speaks

This command is a direct port of libp2p-lookup by mxinden:
https://github.com/mxinden/libp2p-lookup";

pub const P2P_PEERS_LONG_DESCRIPTION: &str = "
'p2p peers' lists the set of peer addresses this node is currently connected to.
The address format is a multiaddress, or 'multiaddr' for short. For example:

  /ip4/104.131.131.82/tcp/4001/p2p/QmaCpDMGvV2BGHeYERUEnRQAwe3N8SzbUtfsmvsqQLuvuJ

The last element after the '/' is the Peer Identifier or 'PeerID'. Either the 
PeerID or the entire multiaddr can be given to the 'p2p lookup' command
for additional details about the peer. For example:

  > beetle p2p lookup QmaCpDMGvV2BGHeYERUEnRQAwe3N8SzbUtfsmvsqQLuvuJ
  > beetle p2p lookup /ip4/104.131.131.82/tcp/4001/p2p/QmaCpDMGvV2BGHeYERUEnRQAwe3N8SzbUtfsmvsqQLuvuJ
