Iroh is a next-generation implementation of the Interplanetary File System ([IPFS](https://ipfs.io)) for Cloud & Mobile platforms.

IPFS is a networking protocol for exchanging _content-addressed_ blocks of immutable data. “Content-addressed” means referring to data by the *hash of its content*, which makes the reference unique and verifiable. These two properties make it possible to get data from *any* node in the network that speaks the IPFS protocol, including IPFS content being served by other implementations of IPFS.

This repo is a common core for three distributions of beetle:

- **Iroh Cloud:** core features of beetle split into configurable microservices, optimized for running at datacenter scale.
- **Iroh One:** A select set of beetle cloud features packaged as a single binary for simplified deployment.
- **Iroh Mobile:** iOS & Android libraries that bring efficient data distribution to mobile apps.

Here is an [install guide](https://beetle.computer/install).
